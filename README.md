This a Space-Themed Trivia Game.

It is a short but timed trivia game.  You have 15 seconds to answer each question.  And each question has 4 answers to choose from but only 1 is correct.  Running out of time will automatically make you miss the question.  Do you have the knowledge to get past this test?

The game has room for expansion into more questions.  It can also be expanded to have categories.  But is just to show you how a timed trivia game can be created using JavaScript and jQuery.
